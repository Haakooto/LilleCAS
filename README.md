# TODO and bugs
This is a in-finite list of elements that has to be done.
When an object is done, do not remove it, but move it from
the "INCOMPLETE" group to the "COMPLETE".

If an object takes considerably longer time to work on,
temporarily move it to the "IN-WORK" group, and write your
github username next to it.
if a completed object needs to be bug-tested, include a % at the beginning

### INCOMPLETE
  - import of locals from any python venv
  - make lp send string into function
  - find better way of finding usr locals
  - read file line by line, determine if locals defined. Only allow lambdas as functions
  - make add and mul collapse nicely
### IN-WORK
  - basic string-comprehension and recognition | bahjemga
  - test
### COMPLETE
  - basicFunctions support
  - import of locals from any python script
### TRASHED
  - rename all objects in our directories to something that a user would never name its own variables
    as the cross-import from the user could create trouble here.

## KNOWN BUGS

### STRING
  - None being printed, or things are printed twice
### IMPORT
  - Unused import in stringHandlig/main, string, number, os

## UNKNOWN BUGS
  - None!
